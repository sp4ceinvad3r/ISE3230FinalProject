# ISE3230FinalProject

Many students focus on making sure that they are getting good/high grades in order to boost their overall gpa. At some point in the semester, students may have the realization that they might not have the grade that they want and need to figure out how to change that. For our project we decided to take the scenario of a student who has some current average in a certain class and is looking to maximize their average at the end of the semester after all grades go in the gradebook. However, they did not manage their time very well and were only left with a very limited amount of time to complete the last few assignments. The time constraint is tight enough to a point where it is impossible to do all of the assignments remaining. The student must now choose how much time, if any, to put into the remaining assignments (based on their weighted impact on the average score) in order to maximize their final average grade in the class.
